## [377. Combination Sum IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/)

[Code](../src/377.combination-sum-iv.cpp)

Changing int to unsigned int can avoid the overflow runtime error. However, the elements in the vector are still wrong...

Similar as [Coin Change 2](2022-03-08.md#518-coin-change-2), with counting different orders multiple times.

## [343. Integer Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/description/)

[Code](../src/343.integer-break.cpp)

For each back checking, the (i - j + 1) * j needs to be considered as a candidate, because when computing the (i - j)th element, the no-break case is not considered.


## [279. Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/)

[Code](../src/279.perfect-squares.cpp)

Same as [Coin Change](2022-03-08.md#322-coin-change)
