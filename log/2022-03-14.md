## [314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-vertical-order-traversal/)

Ambiguous "left" and "right".

Very similar to [987](#987-vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree). The only difference is in the handling of nodes in same row and column.


### Sort

If the two nodes are in the same column and depth, recursively compare their ancestors' column.

Online judge raises error for `[1, 2, 3, null, 4, 5, null, 6, null, 7, null, null, 8, 9, null, 10, null, null, 11]`.

[Code](../src/314.binary-tree-vertical-order-traversal_wrong-order.cpp)


### DFS

After sorting the column and row, the values are kept in a vector, in which the order is ensured by searching left before searching right on each node. So in this term of "left and right", the descendants of the right node can never be on the left side of the descendants of the left node.
