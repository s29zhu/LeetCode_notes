## [336. Palindrome Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs/)

### Trie

[Code](../src/336.palindrome-pairs.cpp)

It can only pass after disabling the destructor... 

__TODO__ Try the method of checking prefix/suffix palindrome + hash table.

## [188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)

[Code](../src/188.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv.cpp)

__TODO__ Try with only one two-dimensional DP array.

## [1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/)

[Code](../src/1249.minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses.cpp)

## [680. Valid Palindrome II](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/)

### Naive skipping

Skip the different letter at most once. The tricky point is, when `s[i + 1] == s[j] && s[i] == s[j - 1]`, hard to decide which side to skip. In this naive solution, we try one first, and try the other if the trail failed. This method may not be generalized to solve Valid palindrom III.

## [1216. Valid Palindrome III](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-iii/)

[Code](../src/1216.valid-palindrome-iii.cpp)

Same as [Longest palindromic subsequence](../src/bin/516.longest-palindromic-subsequence). Early return when palindrom with length `N - k` is found.
