## [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence)

[Code](../src/516.longest-palindromic-subsequence.cpp)

### Review

Optimization:

1. The variable for the longest length is not needed.
2. The plus-two diagonal relation applies for the repeating strings too.
3. If the current two letters are not identical, the left and below elements must be not less than the left-below element.
4. If the current two letters are identical, the current number equals the left-below element plus two, which must be larger than the left and below elements.
