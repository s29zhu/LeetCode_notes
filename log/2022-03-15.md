## [1762. Buildings With an Ocean View](https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/)

[Code](../src/1762.buildings-with-an-ocean-view.cpp)


## [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

[Code](../src/11.container-with-most-water.cpp)

Consider why it is safe to move the pointer which is pointing to the shorter line:

In each computation, since the width is always decreasing, the most water can be contained with the shorter line being used is the amount contained now. So no more combinations with the shorter line need to be computed.


## [1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors](https://leetcode.com/problems/dot-product-of-two-sparse-vectors/)

### Hash

[Code](../src/1570.dot-product-of-two-sparse-vectors.cpp)

Use Hash table to store data. Then use find method for computing the dot product.

[Traversal time complexity of hash set is guaranteed to be O(N) by the standard](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43387247/complexity-of-stdunordered-set-iterator-traversal)

Therefore, the dot product method can be optimized to traverse the smaller hash table.

### Vector of pairs

## [1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/)

### O(N) space

[Code](../src/1650.lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii.cpp)

### O(1) space

[Code](../src/1650.lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii_SO1.cpp)

Exactly same as __Intersection of linked list__


## [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

[Code](../src/160.intersection-of-two-linked-lists.cpp)

> Note: In the case lists do not intersect, the pointers for A and B will still line up at nullptr in the 2nd iteration.
> The distance each pointer travels is `m+n`.
